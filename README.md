# Product Catalog

This is a simple JavaScript project that defines a list of products with their names, prices, and descriptions.

## Description

This code snippet creates an array called `products` containing objects representing different products. Each product object has the following properties:

- `name`: The name of the product.
- `price`: The price of the product.
- `description`: A short description of the product.

## Usage

This code can be used as a starting point for a larger application that displays or interacts with product information. For example, you could:

- **Display product details:** Create a webpage or a console application that iterates through the `products` array and displays the information for each product.
- **Implement search functionality:** Add code to search for products based on their name, price, or description.
- **Add to cart functionality:** Allow users to add products to a shopping cart and calculate the total price.

## Installation

This project does not require any external dependencies or installation. It's a simple JavaScript code snippet that can be run directly in a browser or Node.js environment.

## Example Usage

Here's a simple example of how to access and display the product information:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < products.length; i++) {
  console.log("Product:", products[i].name);
  console.log("Price:", products[i].price);
  console.log("Description:", products[i].description);
  console.log("-----");
}
```

This code iterates through the `products` array and logs the name, price, and description of each product to the console.
